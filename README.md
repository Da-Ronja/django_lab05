We have learned a lot about setting up Models-Templates-Views.
Now its time for you to get some practice!
#Start a new project
#Add a new model called User. It should have these fields:
#First Name
#Last Name
#Email
#Make sure you make the migrations!
#Then create a script that will populate your database with fake Users.
#Then confirm the populating through the Admin interface.
#Then Create a view for your website for the domain extension /users
#This /users page will be an HTML list of the user names and emails.
#You will use template tags to generate this content from the User model.
#Remember to change your urls.py files to deal with the changes to the /users extension!
